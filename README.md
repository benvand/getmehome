# Get Me To Work (without getting run over)



This is a lightweight webapp that checks routes for traffic incidents and general heavy traffic. Upload routes using GPX and the app should do the rest. In theory. Uses Bootstrap, Google Maps api and TFL TIMS Traffic api.

The front page will tell you which routes have traffic on them or whether there is an accident.

This could use more work in the models.py of routes method points_vs_trouble.
Other than that it should work.
